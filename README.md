# PORTFOLIO PROJECT 4

This is a blog that I made with the help of the walkthrough project "I Think Therefore I Blog" for my PP4.
You can upload blogposts as the admin, users can view a list of posts and click on them to read them, users can also make an account to be able to comment and like on the posts, which the admin can approve/delete any comments before they're posted on the website.

## Credits

### Code Used

Code Institute's walkthrough project "I Think Therefore I Blog"

Used as a help/tutorial to make this project, to try to learn and understand what kind of code you use and how it all works. Since I'm quite new to Python, looping, etc, and have some learning disabilities/difficulties it's sometimes a bit difficult to understand or know how/when/where/what code to use.

I also had a lot of problems with errors and the code editor 'CodeAnywhere' which in the end made me restart multiple times because I couldn't solve the issues, ended up changing back to Gitpod.

### Content
